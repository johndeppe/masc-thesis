Maintaining TLB coherence is required for correctness but presents system overheads that impede multi-core scaling. One approach to reduce TLB coherence  overhead is to reduce TLB shootdown costs by sending shootdown messages to only those TLBs that contained the now-invalid page mapping. We investigate the costs of sharer lists for the purpose of shootdown filtering and propose methods for their use.
